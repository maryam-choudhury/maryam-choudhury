## ðŸŒŸ Featured Project: Road Safety Intelligence with Augmented LLM for  Michelin Mobility Intelligence

**Project Description:**
This project uses large language models (LLMs) to analyze and visualize geospatial road safety data. It allows users to query data in natural language and view insights in an interactive Streamlit interface.

**My Contributions:**
- **Data Pipeline:** Implemented a preprocessing system to validate, clean, and structure user-uploaded CSV files for seamless compatibility with LLMs for natural language querying.
- **Advanced Queries:** Developed SQL workflows to support complex, user-driven queries, ensuring robust and secure access to geospatial road safety data.
- **Visualization Integration:** Built geospatial visualizations in Streamlit, highlighting critical insights like accident hotspots and road conditions for actionable decision-making.
- **Collaborated** with the team to integrate these features into the broader project, contributing to its goal of making road safety more data accessible and interpretable. My contributions are in a feature branch under active development.

**Tools:** LangChain, LLaMA, pandas, SQLAlchemy, Streamlit, Kepler
